We aim to encourage punctual attendance through SATS rewards by developing an LN Bits extension for time and attendance tracking.

## Describe the problem you are solving
"Many time and attendance solutions primarily depend on strict rules and penalties, which can contribute to an unfavorable work environment and may not effectively motivate employees to meet attendance expectations.

"We advocate for a shift in focus from punitive to rewards-based systems, as we believe that positive reinforcement could lead to more favorable outcomes."

## Describe the solution / idea you have in mind
We aim to encourage punctual attendance through SATS rewards by developing an LN Bits extension for time and attendance tracking.

The process starts with user identification using LNURL-auth. This triggers a pre-configured time and attendance backend system, which records the timestamp and marks the user as present.

Next, a withdrawal QR code is generated using the LN Bits extension LNURLw. Users can scan this code with a compatible lightning wallet to receive their predetermined SATS reward for arriving on time at the specified location within the designated time frame and date.

Our system ensures transparent attendance recording and promotes good behavior by offering rewards and positive reinforcement, all while safeguarding personal data.

Setting up this solution is straightforward. Organizations need only a basic tablet with data connectivity to access a lightning node running our LNBits Extension. On the other hand, users only require a compatible lightning wallet supporting digital signatures.
